To make a function that creates a binary mask with foreground objects like triangles, circles, rectangles. The mask should be as clean as possible (minimum of noisy pixels and with edges as smooth as possible).
Input: video. Output: video (actual mask).


You will probably need:
* color space transform "cv2.cvtColor",
* threshold "cv2.threshold",
* morphology:
   * Histogram equalization
   * Adaptive threshold
   * Blur
   * Median
   * cv2.filter2D
